# Run MacVim Test in iTerm #

The best way to use this script is to hook it up to a hot key.  
When executed, it will provide you with a list of possible tests to run  
from the file you have highlighted in MacVim.  

If the file is a Cucumber file, then all the Scenarios will be in the  
list of choices along with a default "Run'em All!" that will execute  
the entire file.  

The iTerm tab and session used is the one that is currently visible.
