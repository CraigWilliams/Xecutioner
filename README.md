# Run MacVim Test in iTerm #

The best way to use this script is to hook it up to a hot key.  
When executed, it will provide you with a list of possible tests to run  
from the file you have highlighted in MacVim.  

There are many shortcut managers and I use [Spark](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14352/spark)  
Current setup - change the path to match where you put the files.

# RSpec and Cucumber Files
If the file is a Cucumber file, then all the Scenarios will be in the  
list of choices along with a default "Run'em All!" that will execute  
the entire file.
